# TODO List

A task management application built with Vanilla JavaScript. This project focuses on object-oriented programming principles, module-based code structure, and persistent data storage.

[Live Demo]()

## Built With

* **HTML5 & CSS3** (Custom properties and modern layout techniques)
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Logic, DOM manipulation, and Classes
* **Webpack** - Module bundling and asset management
* **date-fns** - Lightweight library for date formatting

## What I Learned

* **Separation of Concerns:** I learned how to split code into logic modules (handling data) and UI modules (handling the DOM) to keep the codebase maintainable.
* **Object-Oriented Programming:** Implemented classes to create structured task objects.
* **Data Persistence:** Gained experience using the `localStorage` API to ensure user data survives page reloads.
* **Environment Setup:** My first deep dive into using **npm** and **Webpack** to manage dependencies and build a production-ready application.
